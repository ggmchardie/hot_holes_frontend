## Design

### Process
> I was provided with a one page, static site and a logo by the client. Following this I used the same colour scheme, similar font and their logo. I pulled some images from their instagram for the home page and used copyright free images where needed.

##Short Answer

What are the most important aspects of quality software?

> That it fits the requirements and functionality for all users and works correctly

What libraries are being used in the app and why?

> The app is built using the MERN stack (Mongoose, Express, React/Redux, Node). This Stack gives the app the power it needs and allows for further development. 

A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?

> - Agile Methodology

> - Basic HTML/CSS

> - Knowledge of network and database design

> - Rails & Ruby and/or Javascript, Node and React

> **Depends on requirements**

Within your own project what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and overcome challenges?
> Knowledge of how to integrate and use the Full tech stack I was needed. The greatest challenge I faced was that I did not have an in-depth understanding of how the stack all works together. I overcame this with patience, persistence and reaching out to others do have that knowledge.

Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were this project, using examples, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature?
>If viewed as a general learning experience, I feel I gained a lot. I learnt the best tools and libraries to use in future projects and how long generally each step in the build process realistically takes. In the future I would give myself more time and try to focus more time initially on the backend.
